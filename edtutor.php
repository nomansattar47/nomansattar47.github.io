			<h4>EdTutor</h4>
			<p>
After our first launch we have closely monitored and collected feedback from customers. We have addressed and implemented all of the most requested features. Our app was growing and at the we had over <b>10k+ monthly active users</b>. As we were identifying new opportunities to scale the app, we have decided to prepare a better foundation to support future ideas and direction. Redesigning and rebuilding the app in code was a necessary step to move forward. With releasing EdTutor we made the app faster, smarter and more beautiful than ever.

			<h5>My role</h5>
			<p>
The EdTutor team has divided into multiple departments. Me as a <b>Software Engineer ( Web Developer )</b>. While the roles have been somewhat defined.
			</p>
			<p>
I have been the developer for the website from the very beginning, defining the brand and the frameworks and the core user experience. I designed most of the marketing materials, created promotional videos and designed and coded the app's websites.  
			</p>

			<p>
Optimised App Store gallery can boos the conversion rate and is the first important impression of the app. We have run couple of App Store image test, one of which was landscape and portrait image orientation. 
			</p>
			<p>
After some personal insights and some research landscape image can improve the user conversion.  Landscape images can have more impact on search traffic as they take the full width and grab more of the user's attention. 
However we have not seen an increased improvement in the tap-through-rate from the search results to the listing.

		<div class="max-width-70 text-color-black">
			<h5>EdTutor website</h5>
			<p>
I was responsible for the design and the development of the website. It's a simple website built with HTML, CSS and WordPress. The website is a showcase website, whose objective is to present information about the app and subscribe to premium packages.

			<h4>Feedback and reviews</h4>
			<p>
Customer reviews are good indicator that users are engaged with the app. No matter how long or short a review is, user has to take the time to write a review. Both compliments and complaints are key to knowing what to improve or what are the areas that lack some functionality or cause frustrations to the user. Any review can help us understand the user needs. 
			</p>
			<p>
For direct user feedback we have setup HelpScout, an email-based customer support platform that allows our customer to send feedback from within the app. We have separated the feedback into two segmentations one reporting a problem and second suggesting a feature. 
			</p>
			<p>
Another important metrics are the PlayStore ratings. The app ratings are hugely beneficial for users and developers alike and are essential for the app's success. If an app has better ratings it will be considered more relevant and therefore pushed to the top of the search results, making it easier to be discovered.  
			</p>
			<p>
Overall we have <b>1k+ reviews</b> with an average rating of 4.2 out of 5.
