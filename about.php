			<h4>About</h4>
			<p class="size-large">
Hi, I’m Noman. I have 5+ years of experience in wide range of web development disciplines.
			</p>
			<p>
You can also call me a product developer, experience developer, backend developer, fullstack or by any other market defined function-title. I'm also a multi-disciplinary maker with over 5 years of experiences in wide range of development disciplines, advisor, entrepreneur, front-end developer, music enthusiast, traveler and more.
			</p>
			<p>
I don’t like to define myself by the work I’ve done. I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.
			</p>
			<p>
Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I’m easily inspired and more then willing to follow my fascinations wherever they take me. I’m passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit with a natural ability to entertain and inspire. I’m never satisfied to just come up with ideas. Instead I have an almost impulsive need to act on them.
			</p>
			<p>
My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies, areas of study and artistic endeavors. I’m a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles with relative ease.
			</p>
